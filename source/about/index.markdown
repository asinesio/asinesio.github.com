I'm Andy Sinesio.  I love making things, especially software.  [Grails](http://grails.org) and [Objective-C on iOS](http://developer.apple.com/ios) are my current platforms of choice.

I am a software architect for a local company and I also own a software business, [Precognitive Research](http://precognitiveresearch.com), with a lifelong friend of mine.

[Minneapolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis) is one of the greatest places to live in the world; that's why I live here.   I live with five others: my beautiful daughter, my wonderful fianc√©e, a cat, a ball python, and a rabbit.

##Open Source Contributions

Through my company, [Precognitive Research](http://precognitiveresearch.com), I've open sourced the following projects.

### PRKit
[PRKit](http://github.com/asinesio/cocos2d-prkit) is a set of useful tools for working with [cocos2d-iPhone](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org).  

It offers the ability to render a polygon of arbitrary points by triangulating them and filling them with a texture.  

PRKit sprung out of a game prototype where rendering dynamic terrain was critical.  It's been included in several [projects](http://www.pooperpig.com/coding/scrolling-textures-in-cocos2d/) and has been mentioned in a tutorial on [Ray Wenderlich's blog](http://www.raywenderlich.com/14302/how-to-make-a-game-like-fruit-ninja-with-box2d-and-cocos2d-part-1).

### Spectral Flux

[Spectral Flux](http://github.com/asinesio/SpectralFlux) is a beat detection library for iOS.  I'm still working on cleaning it up and getting it to work in a general case, but it should be useful reference for anyone looking for how to analyze songs in a user's iPod library.
