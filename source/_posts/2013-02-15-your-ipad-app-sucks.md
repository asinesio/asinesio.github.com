Yeah. It's harsh, but you know it's true.  Your iPad app probably sucks -- *when compared to your web site.*  

Web browsing on an iPad is a blissful, unique, and sublime experience.  It is, in my estimation, the single greatest advancement in web browsing since the advent of `XMLHttpRequest`.

On an iPad:

* Want to scroll? Grab the page and slide it over *like a piece of paper.* 
* Is the text too small or too large?  Stretch or pinch it *like silly putty.*
* Want to do something special with a word on the page?  *Touch and hold.*

These interactions are so brilliant and obvious that it makes browsing almost any website -- even this one -- *fun*.

Companies know this fact.  And they also know that:

* Visitors are *precious*.  The company has spent millions of dollars on their fancy web site to attract users like you.  
* iPads are used for nearly [all tablet web browsing](http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/27/apple-ipad-dominates-tablet-based-web-browsing-with-98-share-report-says).
* iPad users are great customers -- they're generally [wealthy](http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/ipad-owners-trending-older-wealthier-now-157765) and willing to spend money.
* Pop-up advertisements [annoy the hell](http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/2009/07/consumers-annoyed-with-internet-ads.html) out of customers.
* First impressions are everything.
* The iPad app isn't as functional as the full-fledged web site.

Knowing this, companies still somehow decide to show their precious visitors this monstrosity (source: [XKCD](http://www.xkcd.com))

Maybe their iPad app is wonderful.  I'll never know, though, because that ad -- and by extension, the app -- sucks.
