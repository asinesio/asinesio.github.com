Since Google [announced they were forking WebKit](http://blog.chromium.org/2013/04/blink-rendering-engine-for-chromium.html), I've seen nothing but [universally negative reactions](http://prng.net/blink-faq.html).

The primary points seem to be that Blink is bad because:

#### "Developers will now have another major browser rendering engine that they will need to test."

This is just not true. If you're building quality web software, you are already testing your site on both Chrome and Safari (Mobile and desktop).

A [web monoculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6) is bad for everyone.  A healthy web ecosystem consisting of equal parts Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer means that the users will have a choice, because all web apps will generally need to work with all browsers.

#### "WebKit and Blink will diverge and re-implement each other's features, thus slowing progress."

Google already [wasn't contributing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5490242) much of their code back to WebKit.  The announcement of Blink is truly just formalizing what was already happening.

#### "Google is going to use this to invade my privacy and track me across the Web."

Yes. They were doing that anyway, and they haven't exactly had a great [track record](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2411916,00.asp) of protecting your privacy. If you were concerned about this, you wouldn't be using Chrome anyway.

Think about it; Google forked WebKit for the same reason Apple replaced Google Maps - Google wants to control their own destiny.  

Blink is not the coming of the web browser apocalypse (but it does have a terrible name).

The apocalypse happened when Internet Explorer crushed Netscape. We've recovered from that, and we're never going back.
