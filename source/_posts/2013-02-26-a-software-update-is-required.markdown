My brother gave me [Gran Turismo 5](http://us.gran-turismo.com/us/) for Christmas.  I've played all of the other GT games and loved them. GT5 had been out for awhile, but I was still excited to give it a try.

I returned home from Christmas; after a few days, I finally had a free hour or two, so I booted up the PS3 and threw in the game.  And I was greeted by this:

_14 hours later_, the game finally finished updating and allowed me to play.  Too bad that I no longer had the free hour or two, so it took another week before I was able to actually play the game.

It reminded me of this nefarious monstrosity:

"But, I don't want to update _at all_," I plead.  

The system scoffs. "Tough shit, buddy.  You're going to have to deal with this now because I don't value your time."

####This is the typical experience of today's console gamer.

The advent of attached hard drives and broadband internet in consoles, without any software design, brought this ugliness from the PC to the living room.

It's so bad, in fact, that at Sony's ill-advised PlayStation 4 news conference, they made sure to announce that [background firmware updates would be part of the new system.](http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/ps4-to-have-background-firmware-updates/0111249)  This was astounding because they did not even _show any games or an actual PlayStation 4_ -- but they mentioned background updates.

This isn't enough, though.  Updates also need to be _optional_ and _taken at the user's convenience_.

####Will it matter?
The sad thing is that this is just a microcosm of the usability issues with console systems.  Others:

* Insanely long load times.  
* A Herculean effort _just to type a password with a controller._  
* Exclusive use of a television set.
* Expensive, silly, useless peripherals.
* Lack of downloadable and affordable games.

I don't see the next generation PlayStation addressing these issues.  Or the Xbox, for that matter.  

That's why the iPad is the next generation console.
